Have you installed Windows 11 23h2 or the Moment 4 update? If so, it seems you have the autosave feature. Check in Notepad's Settings and check if you have the option "When Notepad starts"
If that option is set to "Open content to the previous session", autosave is active.
If you still want to be asked to save changes, set it to "Open a new window".
